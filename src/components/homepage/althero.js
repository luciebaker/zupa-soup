But playing such games is risky, especially when it comes to flirting with Theo, a man nearly twice her age with little patience for games. Unless she can keep her distance, itâ€™s only a matter of time before he discovers her secret, but staying away from such a handsome man proves to be a lot easier said than done.</p>
