                    <h4>Caribbean Fantasy Book 3</h4>  
                    <p> Theo’s always had a fantasy of a threesome with twin sisters. While Zoe doesn’t have a twin sister to offer she has an alternative idea: A threesome with his identical twin brother James, who’s coming to stay with them for a week. Theo isn’t keen on sharing Zoe with another man but his twin brother is different. The two have always joked about the idea, but never thought any woman could handle the both of them or would agree to that. If anyone can make their fantasy come true it’s Zoe but is it such a good idea?</p>
